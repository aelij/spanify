# `Span`-ify your code

.NET has introduced low(er)-level memory management APIs over the years that can dramatically reduce the number of allocations and improve performance, and first among them is `Span<T>`.

This repo demonstrates common usage patterns for some of those APIs.

:warning: Always [benchmark](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet) and test the code for correctness, especially when using low-level/unsafe APIs.

:eight: APIs marked with this icon are available in .NET 8. The rest are available in .NET 7.
